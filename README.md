## Security

### What it does

- ✅ Read local Markdown files
- ✅ Store settings locally
- ✅ Access remote URLs (only domains you explicitly authorize)

### What it doesn't

- ❌ Data collection/tracking
- ❌ Network requests to unauthorized domains
- ❌ Access any website without your permission

**Permissions:**

- Required: `storage`, `activeTab`, `scripting`, `file:///*`
- Optional: `https://*/*` (only when you add custom domains in Settings)

## FAQ

### WSL2 files?

Rendering works fine. Hot Reload doesn't work due to Chrome extension
restrictions.
